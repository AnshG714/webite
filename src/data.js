  "I'm a junior studying computer science at Cornell Univerisity. I'm personally heavily invested in developing technology that is directed towards social impact and has the potential to reach the masses, and I'm constantly looking to build fun projects that people can use. As a developer, I also love toying around with different tech stacks. I have experience with native (Swift) and cross platform (React Native) app development, and Ihave recently also been dabbling with frontend and backend development! I'm an active Firebase/GCP user, and I actively use React.js.";
