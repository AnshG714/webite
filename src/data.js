  "Hey there, seems like I have your attention ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Ansh Godha, and Iâ€™m a rising senior studying Computer Science at Cornell University. Iâ€™m particularly invested in developing technology for social impact, and if your company has that as one of its core values, Iâ€™d be very happy to talk! As a developer, I love working with different technologies and frameworks. I have experience with native (iOS) and cross-platform (React Native) mobile development; Iâ€™m also particularly interested in backend development, and I have experience with Firestore and PostgreSQL. Iâ€™ve also worked with GCP on multiple projects before. These days, Iâ€™m learning more about applications of Computer Vision/Augmented Reality and blockchain development. If your company has any work involving these fields, please do reach out to me!";
